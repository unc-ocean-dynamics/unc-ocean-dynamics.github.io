The following animations below encapsulate many of the key science questions that motivate my research.

### Simulations of Greenland's Glacial Fjords

Preliminary work on the Greenland Regional Intra-Fjord Flux and Interaction Numerics (GRIFFIN) project, which aims to be the first complete set of high-resolution simulations for all deep-water fjords in Greenland.
The movie shows the near surface (z=-150 m) vorticity in a few deep warm-water glacial fjords.

### Idealized Submesoscale-resolving Fjord Simulations

An idealized high resolution bathtub-like glacial fjord model showing the mean circulation and various sources of instability (16 m horizontal and 5 m vertical grid spacing).
The movie shows the vorticity at various depths.

### Standing Eddies within Fjords

A realistic fjord geometry (Ilulissat Icefjord) demonstrating the emergence and evolution of standing eddies driven by meltwater and discharge plume parameterizations at the glacier boundary. The movie shows 3D surfaces of vorticity.
