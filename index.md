Welcome to the **Carolina Dynamical Oceanography Group** at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

We study the physics of ocean circulation, especially in polar and coastal regions where the ocean interacts with ice and freshwater. Our research integrates **theory**, **numerical modeling**, and **observations** to investigate how geophysical flows shape climate-relevant processes â€” from glacial melt to shelf sea dynamics.

Our work is grounded in questions such as:
- How does ocean circulation drive glacial melting in fjords and under ice shelves?
- How is freshwater from the Arctic and Greenland transported across shelves into the open ocean?
- What role do winds, eddies, and topography play in modulating these processes?

We actively collaborate with national and international programs including **OSNAP**, **SWOT**, and **ECCO**, and we use tools ranging from **high-resolution models** to **in situ** and **remote sensing data**.

### ðŸ‘¥ About the Group

The group is led by [Ken Zhao](/people/) (Assistant Professor, UNC-CH), a physical oceanographer with expertise in polar and coastal dynamics.  
We welcome collaborations and are actively building a team of postdocs and graduate students.
