Welcome to the **Carolina Dynamical Oceanography Group** at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

We study the physics of ocean circulation, especially in polar and coastal regions where the ocean interacts with ice and freshwater. Our research integrates **theory**, **numerical modeling**, and **observations** to investigate the geophysical dynamics of our evolving polar and coastal oceans.

We actively collaborate with national and international and groups and use tools ranging from **high-resolution models** to **in situ** and **remote sensing data**.

### About the Group

The group is led by [Ken Zhao](/people/) (Assistant Professor, UNC-CH), a physical oceanographer with expertise in polar and coastal dynamics.  
We welcome collaborations and are actively building a team of postdocs and graduate students.

### Join Us

We will be recruiting **Ph.D. and undergraduate students to begin in 2026**.  
If you are interested in ocean physics, polar regions, or geophysical fluid dynamics, [get in touch](mailto:kenzhao@unc.edu)!
