## Outreach and Engagement

Members of the Carolina Dynamical Oceanography Group are committed to engaging with the broader community through science communication, mentoring, and education.

We have contributed to events such as **UCLA’s Exploring Your Universe** (2019 and 2020), a public science outreach event for K–12 students and their families.

We also participate regularly as science judges at regional **National Ocean Science Bowl** competitions for high school students.

If you’re interested in collaborating on outreach events or inviting us to participate, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:kenzhao@unc.edu).
