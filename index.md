---------------------

Welcome to the **Carolina Dynamical Oceanography Group** at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

We study the physics of ocean circulation, especially in polar and coastal regions where the ocean interacts with ice and freshwater. Our approach integrates **theory**, **numerical modeling**, **laboratory experiments**, and **observations** across spatial scales to investigate the dynamics that underpin these complex systems.

We actively collaborate with other groups nationally and internationally and use tools spanning **idealized and realistic models** to **laboratory wave tanks** to **in situ** and **remote sensing data**.

### About the Group

The group is led by [Ken Zhao](/people/) (Assistant Professor, UNC Chapel Hill), a physical oceanographer with expertise in polar and coastal dynamics.  
We welcome collaborations and are actively building a team of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates.

### Join Us

We will be recruiting **Ph.D. and undergraduate students to begin in 2026**.  
If you are interested in ocean physics, polar regions, or geophysical fluid dynamics, [get in touch](mailto:kenzhao@unc.edu)!

Stay tuned for updates on our research, people, and publications.
